# Arduino Temperature Monitoring Project

## Overview
This project involves using an Arduino board to read temperature data from a TMP36 sensor and display it on a 16x2 LCD. Additionally, an LED is used as a visual indicator. The project includes a potentiometer for contrast adjustment on the LCD.

## Project Structure
- `/docs`: Contains documentation files.
  - `user_manual.txt`: User manual for the project.
- `/schematics`: Schematic diagrams.
  - `circuit_diagram.png`: Circuit diagram image file.
- `/simulations`: Simulation files.
