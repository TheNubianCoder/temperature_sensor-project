# User Manual

## Overview
This Arduino-based temperature monitoring system reads data from a TMP36 sensor and displays it on a 16x2 LCD. The LED serves as a visual indicator. A potentiometer is included for adjusting the LCD contrast.

## Setup Instructions
1. Connect the TMP36 sensor, LCD, and potentiometer to the Arduino following the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino code from the `/src` directory to your Arduino board.
3. Power on the Arduino.

## LCD Contrast Adjustment
Use the potentiometer to adjust the contrast of the LCD for optimal visibility. Turn the potentiometer until the text on the LCD is clearly visible.

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter issues, refer to the README.md or consult the project's community for assistance.

Enjoy monitoring the temperature with your Arduino project!
